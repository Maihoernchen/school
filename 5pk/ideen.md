### Fragenanpassung
* Dramatische Darstellung / Heroisierung
* Müssen moderne Darstellungen "verfälschen" um historisch präzise zu sein?
	* Übertreibung zur korrekten Darstellung nach modernen Maßstäben
	* Aufgabe des Theaters zu Überspitzung
	* Umfrage Filmeinfluss direktvergleich

### Problem der historischen Präzision
* Können wir wissen was passiert ist?
* Gibt es Meinungsverschiedenheiten unter den Quellen?
* Jede moderne Darstellung von Geschichte ist "verfälscht", weil verkürtzt.
* Ist Verkürzung = Verfälschung?
